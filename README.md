# LiveFractal
Livefractal is a fractal generator with arbitrary floating point precision, based on the Python 3 decimal class. The fractal class does the imaginary-plane computations, while the renderer function manages colouring, exploration and uploading.

The software is able to constantly explore new parts of the Mandelbrot Set on its own. Combined with the PhP server and android app (https://github.com/runezor/LiveFractalAP), your phone wallpaper will update to always update to display the most recently generated fractal, allowing you to constantly have a new and never-seen-before wallpaper. You get to explore the mandelbrot set, without slowing your phone down or wasting battery
